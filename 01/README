Remarks
-------
* Using the primitive NAND gate, the NOT gate was built. From that point, every
2-way gate was built on top of previously built chips in the listed order.
4-way and bitwise gates were built using the respective 2-way gates. 8-way gates
were built using respective 4-way gates as well.
