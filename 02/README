HalfAdder.hdl - A half adder. Adds 2 bits.
FullAdder.hdl - A half adder. Adds 3 bits.
Add16.hdl - An adder. Adds two 16-bit numbers.
Inc16.hdl - Increments a 16-bit number by 1.
ALU.hdl - An arithmetic logic unit. Performs a number of functions on
 two 16-bit inputs.
ShiftLeft.hdl - Multiplies a 16-bit input by 2, shifting
 all bits one place to the left.
ShiftRight.hdl - Divides a 16-bit input by 2, shifting
 all bits one place to the right.
Mul.hdl - Multiplies 2 16-bit inputs.

Remarks
-------
* Multiplication of binary numbers is achieved by taking the first number
 and multiplying it by each bit in the second number. Each time we multiply,
 we shift the first number to the right. These temporary products are called
 partial product. These are then summed to give us the correct output.
