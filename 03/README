Bit.hdl - A 1-bit register. Maintains 1 bit of memory.
Register.hdl - A 16-bit register.
RAM8.hdl - 16-bit / 8-register memory
RAM64.hdl - 16-bit / 64-register memory

Remarks
-------
* In addition to the primitive DFF chip and chips built on other chips produced
 during the current project, Muxing and Demuxing were used frequently in order
 to properly select a register with a given n-bit address.
