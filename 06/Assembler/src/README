                           Project 6 - Assembler
                           ----------------------
     The Assembler class receives 1 argument: The path to an ASM file/folder
     
     The program performs 3 passes over the code:
     
     1. Removal of comments and spaces
     2. Extraction of label symbols and storing them in the symbol HashMap
     3. Translation of remaining commands into hack machine code
     
     The storage of symbols and translations of commands are stored in HashMaps
     defined in Consts.java

makefile - Compiles the Assembler project
Assembler - Executed the compiled project
Assembler.java - The main program: receives an argument containing the ASM
				file/folder path and reads the file, sends the text to the 
				parser and writes the hack machine language output to .hack file
				in the original directory
Parser.java - A class that receives ASM text code and translates it
				into hack machine code
Consts.java - A class storing constants used throughout the code, including
				the translations of parts of ASM commands to their appropriate
				bits.
