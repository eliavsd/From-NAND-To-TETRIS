                           Project 7 - Compiler part I
                           ----------------------
     The VMtoAssemblerTranslator class receives 1 argument: The path to a .VM file or a path to a 
     directory which has .vm files. 
     
     This class instances a VMparser instance to each and every .vm file, and a single 
     AssemblerWriter instance to write all of the translated Virtual Language to Assembly Language.
     It writes the translted commands in a single .asm file which have the name of the given path,
     as well as being saved to the given path.
